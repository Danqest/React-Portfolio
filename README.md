# Creating a Project Portfolio in React

This project is an exercise in creating a personal project portfolio in React with Bootstrap styling and deploying it to Github Pages.

Upon visting the application at the deployed URL, the user is presented with the landing page which is the About section. Displayed is a header, navbar, the main content, and a footer. When a user clicks on each button in the navbar a new page is rendered. The project requires the planning of a webpage and contains outside links to other Github projects, a personal Github repository, and LinkedIn. The page displayes the developer's name, avatar, links to the associated projects, Github repos, and the deployed application. Examples of projects have titles and images for application.
